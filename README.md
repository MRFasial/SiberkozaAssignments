# My Own Dataset
i got my dataset from Kaagle CrabSexPredictions and using steps of Trainers Code i decided to predict the Gender of Crabs according to their Length	Diameter	Height	Weight	Shucked Weight	Viscera Weight	Shell Weight	Age.
unlike the Trainers code my code has 8 inputs instead of 2, so when i decided to predict using my AI i have to input those 8.
Thank you.
